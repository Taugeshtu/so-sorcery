   - Basic context building
   - File read/write tools
   - Reference arrows (this is the big visual feature!)
   - Copy buttons
   - Undo/Redo (VS Code's built-in document undo should work?)
   - Multiple agent types (your "psyches")
   - Better tool ecosystem
   - Knowledge auto-naming
   - remove available files list from the json?..
   - more robust error handling on the backend pls?
   - maybe streaming support?

...fuck... nooo, you know what, I think a better design would be to have built-ins, and have a way for the user to add their own agents (globally for extension) - is there a global storage for extension that's NOT settings? That'd be valuable.
But for now let's simplify, just bundled.
